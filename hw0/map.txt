- Use objdump with the -D flag on the map executable. Which of the addresses from the output of running ./map are defined in the executable, and which segment/section is each defined in?
	recur is in .text
	main is in .text


- Make a list of the important segments, and what they are used for (look up their names on the Internet if you donâ€™t know).
	.text for instructions that are going to be called
	.data for variables


- What direction is the stack growing in?
	The stack is growing downward

- How large is the stack frame for each recursive call?
	4 * 12 = 48 byes

- Where is the heap? What direction is it growing in?
	The heap is on top of the stack. The heap is growing upward.

- Are the two malloc()ed memory areas contiguous? (e.g. is there any extra space between their addresses?)
	They are not contiguous. Between them, there is a space of 112 bytes.
