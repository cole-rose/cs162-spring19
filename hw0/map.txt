- Use objdump with the -D flag on the map executable. Which of the addresses from the output of running ./map are defined in the executable, and which segment/section is each defined in?



- Make a list of the important segments, and what they are used for (look up their names on the Internet if you donâ€™t know).



- What direction is the stack growing in?


- How large is the stack frame for each recursive call?


- Where is the heap? What direction is it growing in?


- Are the two malloc()ed memory areas contiguous? (e.g. is there any extra space between their
addresses?)
